    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was my second or third week as a consultant at a prestigious Telecommunications Company. To beat traffic, I would get up at 4 A.M everyday. Each drive would only take me 12 songs, but I had to wait in the parking lot for 36 more songs and two cups of coffee.</p>

<p>After the introductory twenty-dollar tour, I realized I was in Hell. The whole team that kept their infrastructure from burning had resigned and left the same way you would avoid a plague. Documentation was outdated and mostly useless. There was no version control for their in-house software which was written using .NET (2.0), T-SQL, Java, Python and PHP. As if this wasn&rsquo;t enough, I was alone with two <del>charming</del> managers who didn&rsquo;t seem to be aware of their sinking ship.</p>

<p>There was a list of tasks that had to be done weekly. One of them involved running a few python scripts that would screen-scrape customer data from an ancient server, parse each entry with a RegEx recipe that looked like a black magic spell to finally insert the result into an unpatched vintage SQL Server. These scripts would get the username, unencrypted password and host to scrape from an internal web service. There was no way of telling if something went wrong until a few days. As I fired each process, this is really what went through my mind:
This is no different from stabbing in the dark.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t get into details, but let&rsquo;s just say the rest of their system was a ghetto. I&rsquo;ve read about drug cartels with better workflows. I envied the janitors, even though our jobs were closely related. We both had to clean up these people&rsquo;s shit.</p>

<p>The week was almost over. One more game of Solitaire and I would finally go home. Suddenly, I get an email saying they can&rsquo;t generate some reports and they&rsquo;re pissed off. After giving away an extra-hour and doing some Sherlock-worthy guess work I noticed there were two versions of the screen-scraper. An unfinished &ldquo;backup&rdquo; made during the development of the script and the final version I should have ran. It&rsquo;s an understatement to say I had fucked up big time.</p>

<h3>Problems are opportunities in disguise</h3>

<p>It could be argued that the situation could have been avoided If I had inherited better documentation but I blame myself. Like many developers, I let my ego get in the way. The little perfectionist inside me had focused more on their flaws and how bad their system was designed instead of taking a more positive approach: doing the best you can with what you have. Problems are opportunities in disguise.</p>

<h3>Fail Driven Development (FDD)</h3>

<p>Since this incident I adopted a personal development cycle I based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Fail Driven Development</strong> consists of three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Life writes a failing test for you</li>
<li>You write your fate, you make it pass</li>
<li>Clean up and remove any unnecessary concept, behavior or belief slowing you down</li>
</ol>


<p>This cycle is constantly taking place, don&rsquo;t be lazy and fix your bugs!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As developers, we are in a constant race against technical and knowledge debt. Like it or not, it&rsquo;s impossible to win. By default, we are deprecateware; we are destined to grow irrelevant and be replaced eventually. Usually someone younger with a higher threshold for pain and a full tank of tolerance ready for your textbook example of software archeology, ancient practices and verbosity monstrosity you shamelessly call code.</p>

<p>To delay this natural cycle and leave a mark, we have to be willing to try new things and adapt fast. Go ahead and experiment, dive deep into it until you can build something new. This integration process is often a loop that requires a lot of time, patience and commitment; We trade-in productivity for new knowledge; we leave our comfort zone in exchange for a possible lethal dose of frustration, anger and even depression. To discard any new programming language, framework or software as hype-technology; and let ourselves slowly fade into the background is simpler and requires no effort.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to attack and destroy an act of creation. It&rsquo;s a lot more difficult to perform one.&rdquo; &ndash; Chuck Palahniuk</p></blockquote>

<h2>Become a Polyglot</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t conform to a single language, infrastructure or database. Push yourself to learn new skills. Being able to properly write tests and code in more than one language will make you more valuable. Being diverse means less limits, new horizons. Transferring newly acquired knowledge not only help others, it solidifies your understanding of it.</p>

<h2>Innovation and Fear of Failure</h2>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An innovation is something <strong>original, new, and important</strong> &ndash; in whatever field &ndash; that breaks in to (or obtains a foothold in) a market or society.&rdquo;(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation">wikipedia</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>BULLSHIT</strong>.</p>

<p>Innovation is a result of combining existent elements or ideas that were waiting to be merged. Innovation is ever omnipresent, it is not sporadic nor a one-time event. When you open source a project or contribute in a community like <a href="https://www.github.com">Github</a> or <a href="https://www.bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>, you take part in the innovation iteration. No matter how simple, unstable or insignificant you may think your code or contribution is; you are changing the World with each commit. To be aware of this privilege and power should be enough to get through your head that you can&rsquo;t fail even if you&rsquo;d try to. Fear of failure is as illogical as fear of drowning in bed. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRB8Jor8tPs">Shun the non-believers!</a> Your code might save someone&rsquo;s life tomorrow.</p>

<p>Be a GitThug, embrace change and you&rsquo;ll get a GitHug :)</p>
